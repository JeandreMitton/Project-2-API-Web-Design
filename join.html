            <h1>I'm Jeandr√© Mitton, Welcome to my technical CV</h1>
            <p>I am a student currently persuing my degree as Bachelor of Science for Information Technology & Computer Science</p></br>
            <p>I created this site as a technical CV after having received it as a project from a lecturer during the module IT Developments to give me an edge over the average Software Engineer.</p></br>
            <p>While doing the project I had absolutely no knowlegde in the Web Development field and coding environment but as soon as I started doing research, learning JavaScript, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets I realized how similar the syntax styles are to languages I learned during my studies and it transformed the project from work to pleasure from my perspective.</p>
